# hackathonHttpPost


Working with main project:

  - this works for sending a JSON string to the mulesoft app,
  - see the main method for how it is being instantiated. 
  - should simply need to add the method to trainee service in your project and pass it the JSON representation of the trainee using 
  the JSONUtil import.
  - should only need the entryPoint class.
